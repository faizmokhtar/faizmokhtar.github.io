Create Terraform file. Eg: `main.tf`\n2. Define configuration\n3. Run `terraform init`\n4. Run `terraform plan` to see what Terraform wiill do\n5. Run `terraform apply` to actually create the instance\n\n# Terraform State\n\n- Records information about what infrastructure it created in `.tfstate`.\n- The state file `.tfstate` is a **Private API**\n    - Should nenver be edited or referenced directly\n- It should not be commited into git repo\n- The best way to manage shared storage for state file is through remote backend\n    - There's limitation\n        - It's a 2 step process for when creating & deleting\n        - `backend` block in Terraform does not allow us to use any variables or references\n- Be paranoid with how we store our state files. Always enable encryption and who we allow access to it.\n\n### Example of creating Terraform Backend\n- `.tfstate` is stored in S3 and DynamoDB is used for locking\n```\nprovider \"aws\" {\n    region = \"ap-southeast-1\"\n}\n\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"terraform_state\" {\n    bucket = \"toy-terraform-state-fm\"\n\n    # prevent accidental deletion of this s3 bucket\n    lifecycle {\n        prevent_destroy = true\n    }\n\n    versioning {\n        enabled = true\n    }\n\n    # enable server-side encryption by default\n    server_side_encryption_configuration {\n        rule {\n            apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {\n              sse_algorithm = \"AES256\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nresource \"aws_dynamodb_table\" \"terraform_locks\" {\n    name = \"toy-terraform-state-locks-fm\"\n    billing_mode = \"PAY_PER_REQUEST\"\n    hash_key = \"LockID\"\n\n    attribute {\n        name = \"LockID\"\n        type = \"S\"\n    }\n}\n\n# Example of using remote backend to avoid commiting `.tfstate`\n# It solved the following issues:\n# 1. manual error\n# 2. locking (with Dynamo DB)\n# 3. secrets (with S3 and IAM policies)\n\n# Run `terraform init` again to instruct terraform to store state file in S3 bucket\nterraform {\n  backend \"s3\" {\n      bucket = \"toy-terraform-state-fm\"\n      key = \"global/s3/terraform.tfstate\"\n      region = \"ap-southeast-1\"\n\n      dynamodb_table = \"toy-terraform-state-locks-fm\"\n      encrypt = true\n  }\n}\n```","url":"https://notes.faizmokhtar.com/notes/043c2a82-5512-4493-9eac-7752d9a12a7b.html","relUrl":"notes/043c2a82-5512-4493-9eac-7752d9a12a7b.html"},{"doc":"Jenkins","title":"Jenkins","hpath":"tool.jenkins","content":"\n## To install Jenkins with Docker\n\n1. login to Docker\n2. run the followings\n````\n$~ docker pull jenkins/jenkins:lts\n$~ docker run --detach --publish 8080:8080 --volume\njenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home --name jenkins jenkins/jenkins:lts\n$~ docker exec jenkins cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword\n````\n3. copy the password and open localhost:8080\n4. install suggested plugins\n\n## Type of jobs in Jenkins\n\n1. freestyle job (most commonly used)\n2. pipeline job\n3. multi-configuration job\n4. github organization job\n5. multibranch job","url":"https://notes.faizmokhtar.com/notes/420ac6e2-a1db-40ea-8c0f-cfe93d8dca24.html","relUrl":"notes/420ac6e2-a1db-40ea-8c0f-cfe93d8dca24.html"},{"doc":"Git","title":"Git","hpath":"tool.git","content":"\n## Git Cheatsheet\n\n### Squashing 4 commits\n```\ngit checkout $BRANCH_NAME\ngit rebase -i $BRANCH_NAME~4 $BRANCH_NAME\n\n# at interactive screen\n# then choose the fixup for commit: 2/3/4\n\ngit push -u origin +$BRANCH_NAME\n```","url":"https://notes.faizmokhtar.com/notes/f6ceb740-2750-4244-950f-a384298bd226.html","relUrl":"notes/f6ceb740-2750-4244-950f-a384298bd226.html"},{"doc":"Docker","title":"Docker","hpath":"tool.docker","content":"\n# Docker Cheatsheet\n\n### To display Docker version & info\n```\ndocker --version\ndocker version\ndocker info\n```\n\n### To execute Docker image\n```\ndocker run $IMAGE_NAME\n```\n\n### To list all Docker images\n```\ndocker image ls\n```\n\n### To list Docker containers\n```\ndocker container ls # runnning\ndocker container ls --all # all, even one that's not running\ndocker container ls --aq # all in quiet mode\n```\n\n### To create image using current directory's Dockerfile\n```\ndocker build -t $CONTAINER_NAME .\n```\n\n### To run $CONTAINER_NAME and map port 4000 to 80\n```\ndocker run -p 4000:80 $CONTAINER_NAME\ndocker run -d -p 4000:80 $CONTAINER_NAME # Same thing, but in detached mode\n```\n","url":"https://notes.faizmokhtar.com/notes/e4789c61-e98a-44c0-99b6-e996b0aa4a48.html","relUrl":"notes/e4789c61-e98a-44c0-99b6-e996b0aa4a48.html"},{"doc":"Bash","title":"Bash","hpath":"tool.bash","content":"\n# Bash Cookbook\n\n## To redirect output and error messages to different files\n\n```\nmyprogram 1> message.out 2> message.err\n```\n\n## To throw output away\n\nUse `/dev/null`.
